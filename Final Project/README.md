# Final Project

### Topic: Hybrid Monte Carlo Algorithm and Application

The report introduces the background of Hybrid Monte Carlo and its algorithm. We ran the simulation for multivariate normal distribution using MHC with diï¬€erent parameters. In addition, we compared the results from MHC and Metropolis-Hasting algorithms and found that simulation from MHC has better convergence and more stable.
